# Quick Reference: Audio/Video Calling - What Was Fixed

## 🎯 TL;DR - The Problem
**You couldn't hear each other during calls because:**
1. Missing microphone/camera permissions on Android and iOS
2. No audio processing (echo cancellation, noise suppression)
3. Remote audio tracks weren't explicitly enabled

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Android Permissions (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)
Added:
- ✅ `CAMERA` permission
- ✅ `RECORD_AUDIO` permission  
- ✅ `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` permission
- ✅ `BLUETOOTH` permissions

### 2. iOS Permissions (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`) 
Created new file with:
- ✅ Camera usage description
- ✅ Microphone usage description

### 3. Audio Quality (`lib/services/webrtc_service.dart`)
Enhanced with:
- ✅ Echo cancellation
- ✅ Noise suppression
- ✅ Auto gain control
- ✅ High-pass filter
- ✅ Typing noise detection

### 4. Remote Audio Tracks
- ✅ Explicitly enable all incoming audio tracks
- ✅ Verify both local and remote tracks are working
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging

## 🚀 What You Need To Do

### IMPORTANT: Rebuild Required!
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**Why?** Platform permission changes require a full rebuild.

### Test Checklist:
1. ☐ Install rebuilt app on TWO real devices
2. ☐ Grant microphone permission when prompted
3. ☐ User A calls User B
4. ☐ Verify both can hear each other
5. ☐ Test mute button
6. ☐ Test video call (if needed)

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Check Console Logs
Look for these success messages:
```
✅ Local stream obtained: 1 tracks
✅ Track added: audio - ID: ...
📥 Received remote track: audio
✅ Remote stream set with 1 tracks
🎉 Call connected! Verifying audio tracks...
```

### If Still Not Working:
1. Check if permissions were granted (Settings → App → Permissions)
2. Restart app after granting permissions
3. Check network connection (both devices should be online)
4. Try with different devices
5. Review full logs in `docs/AUDIO_VIDEO_CALLING_FIX.md`

## 📱 Platform-Specific Notes

### Android:
- First call will show permission dialog
- User MUST tap "Allow" for microphone
- If denied, go to Settings → Apps → StudyPals → Permissions

### iOS:
- First call will show permission dialog
- User MUST tap "Allow" for microphone/camera
- If denied, go to Settings → StudyPals → toggle on Microphone/Camera

### Web:
- Browser will show permission prompt in URL bar
- Click "Allow" for microphone/camera access
- Works best in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Audio Path (Simplified):
```
Your Mic → Local Track → WebRTC → Internet → WebRTC → Remote Track → Friend's Speaker
```

### What The Fixes Do:
- **Permissions** = Your app can access the microphone
- **Echo Cancellation** = Prevents feedback loops
- **Track Enabling** = Ensures audio flows both directions
- **Logging** = Helps debug if something goes wrong

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test on real devices** - Emulators don't have real microphones
2. **Grant permissions** - Check app settings if call fails
3. **Check volume** - Make sure device volume is up
4. **Try headphones** - Reduces echo on some devices
5. **Same network first** - Test on WiFi before cellular

## 📞 Support

If issues persist after rebuild:
1. Check `docs/AUDIO_VIDEO_CALLING_FIX.md` for detailed troubleshooting
2. Share console logs (they now have detailed debug info)
3. Verify both users have latest app version
4. Test with different device combinations

**Bottom Line:** Rebuild the app, grant permissions, and you should be able to hear each other! 🎉
