## 📈 Performance Integration

### Adaptive Difficulty System
```dart
// Example of how difficulty is automatically adjusted
String getRecommendedDifficulty(String subject) {
  final performance = subjectPerformance[subject];
  if (performance == null) return 'moderate';
  
  if (performance.accuracy >= 0.9) return 'challenging';
  if (performance.accuracy >= 0.8) return 'moderate';
  if (performance.accuracy >= 0.7) return 'easy';
  return 'easy';
}
```

### Performance Levels
- **Expert** (90%+ accuracy): Advanced concepts and challenging applications
- **Advanced** (80-89% accuracy): Complex reasoning with practical applications
- **Intermediate** (70-79% accuracy): Balanced facts and understanding
- **Developing** (60-69% accuracy): Foundational support with encouragement
- **Beginner** (<60% accuracy): Basic concepts with extensive guidance

## 🛠️ Implementation Examples

### Basic AI Generation with Personalization
```dart
final aiService = AIService();
final cards = await aiService.generateFlashcardsFromText(
  content: "Object-oriented programming concepts",
  subject: "Computer Science",
  user: currentUser,
  count: 5,
  analytics: userAnalytics, // Optional but highly recommended
);
```

### Session Tracking with Performance Updates
```dart
final analyticsProvider = Provider.of<AnalyticsProvider>(context);

// Start study session
await analyticsProvider.startStudySession(
  userId: user.id,
  subject: "Computer Science",
);

// Record activities
analyticsProvider.recordCardView(cardId, "Computer Science");
analyticsProvider.recordAnswer(cardId, wasCorrect, responseTime, "Computer Science");

// End session and update analytics
await analyticsProvider.endStudySession(user.id);
