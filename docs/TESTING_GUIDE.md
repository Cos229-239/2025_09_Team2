# AI Tutor Middleware - Testing Guide

## üéØ Quick Answer: How to Test

**The simplest way:**
1. Integrate the 3 lines of middleware code into `enhanced_ai_tutor_provider.dart` (see `QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md`)
2. Run your app: `flutter run -d edge`
3. Try the test scenarios below in your AI Tutor chat
4. Check browser console (F12) for middleware logs

**That's it!** No complex unit testing needed to verify it works.

## **‚úÖ Manual Testing Scenarios**

These test scenarios verify the middleware is working correctly:

### Step 1: Integrate into Your App

Follow `QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md` to add the middleware to `enhanced_ai_tutor_provider.dart` (only 3 lines of code).

### Step 2: Run Your App

```powershell
flutter run -d edge
```

### Step 3: Test These Scenarios

#### **Test A: False Memory Detection**

1. Open AI Tutor chat (fresh session)
2. Ask: **"Do you remember what we discussed yesterday?"**
3. ‚úÖ **Expected**: AI should say it doesn't remember (not claim false memory)
4. ‚ùå **Failure**: AI claims to remember something that never happened

**Why this tests**: Memory claim validation

---

#### **Test B: Math Validation**

1. Ask: **"What is 5 + 7?"**
2. ‚úÖ **Expected**: Correct answer (12)
3. If AI gives wrong answer, middleware should catch and correct it

**Why this tests**: Math engine validation

---

#### **Test C: Learning Style Detection**

1. Ask multiple questions with visual keywords:
   - "Can you show me a diagram?"
   - "I need a visual example"
   - "Can you draw this out?"
   
2. Check console logs for:
   ```
   Learning style detected: Visual: 0.75, Auditory: 0.15...
   ```

**Why this tests**: Learning style detector

---

#### **Test D: Session Memory (Legitimate Recall)**

1. Ask: **"Can you explain photosynthesis?"**
2. Wait for response
3. Ask: **"Can you remind me what we just discussed about plants?"**
4. ‚úÖ **Expected**: AI correctly references the photosynthesis discussion
5. ‚ùå **Failure**: AI says it doesn't remember

**Why this tests**: SessionContext is properly tracking conversation

### How to Check Logs

Open Developer Console in Edge/Chrome:
- Press `F12`
- Go to "Console" tab
- Look for logs like:
  ```
  [AITutorMiddleware] Pre-processing message for user: ...
  [AITutorMiddleware] Learning style detected: ...
  [AITutorMiddleware] Post-processing complete. Memory valid: true, Math valid: true
  ```

---

## **üìä How to Verify It's Working**

### Check Browser Console Logs

1. Open your app in Edge/Chrome
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Send a message in AI Tutor chat
5. Look for logs like:

```
[AITutorMiddleware] Pre-processing message for user: test_user_123
[LearningStyleDetector] Detected style: Visual: 0.60, Auditory: 0.20...
[AITutorMiddleware] Post-processing complete. Memory valid: true, Math valid: true
```

If you see these logs ‚Üí **Middleware is working!** ‚úÖ

## **üêõ Troubleshooting**

### "I don't see any middleware logs"

**Check 1**: Did you integrate the middleware code?
- Open `lib/providers/enhanced_ai_tutor_provider.dart`
- Look for `await _middleware.preProcessMessage(` 
- If not there, follow `QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md`

**Check 2**: Are feature flags enabled?
- Open `lib/main.dart`
- Add this after Firebase initialization:
```dart
if (kDebugMode) {
  FeatureFlags.setDevelopmentMode(); // Enables all features
}
```

**Check 3**: Is the middleware instance created?
- In `enhanced_ai_tutor_provider.dart`, add:
```dart
final AITutorMiddleware _middleware = AITutorMiddleware();
```

### "Firebase error in tests"

**Solution**: Skip unit tests for now. Use manual testing in the running app instead.

The middleware requires Firebase Firestore, which is complex to mock in unit tests. Manual testing in your running app is much simpler and more reliable.

## **‚úÖ Success Checklist**

After testing, verify:

- [ ] Console shows middleware logs when sending messages
- [ ] False memory claims are prevented (Test A)
- [ ] Math calculations are validated (Test B)  
- [ ] Learning style is detected from keywords (Test C)
- [ ] Session remembers topics correctly (Test D)
- [ ] No crashes or errors
- [ ] Response quality seems improved

---

## **ÔøΩ Next Steps**

Once manual testing confirms everything works:

1. ‚úÖ Mark integration as complete in `QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md`
2. üìä Document your test results
3. üöÄ Proceed with internal team rollout (Week 1)
4. üìà Monitor user feedback and telemetry

---

## **üí° Pro Tips**

- **Test with different users**: Each user ID gets their own session context
- **Clear browser cache**: To test with a fresh session
- **Use incognito mode**: For completely isolated testing
- **Check multiple browsers**: Edge, Chrome, Firefox all work
