   - **Examples:** Q1, Q8, Q15, Q20, Q24, Q28, Q34
   - **Pattern:** Extracting random words from middleware badges and meta-questions
   - **Root Cause:** `_checkMemoryConsistency()` in `ai_tutor_middleware.dart` is overly sensitive

2. **Duplicate False Warnings (Q20)**
   - **Severity:** MEDIUM
   - **Impact:** Same warning appears twice in one response
   - **Root Cause:** Middleware running twice or bug in formatting

3. **Context Confusion (Q16-17)**

**Weaknesses:**
- False memory warnings break immersion (30% of responses!)
- No cross-session memory ("yesterday" doesn't work)
- Session loading takes too long (5+ seconds)
- Minor bugs in validation and context handling

**Bottom Line:** Fix the critical bugs (Priority 1) and this becomes an **A+ tutor**! üéØ
