# StudyPals - Comprehensive Implementation Roadmap
## Critical Missing Functionality and Placeholder Logic Analysis

**Generated:** $(Get-Date)
**Status:** Requires Immediate Development Attention
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Most Features Are Mock/Placeholder Implementations

---

## üö® EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current State:** StudyPals has extensive UI and basic functionality but **MOST ADVANCED FEATURES ARE PLACEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATIONS** with mock data and fake functionality.

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Application appears functional but lacks real backend implementation for major features.

**Immediate Action Required:** Prioritize implementation of core services and infrastructure before adding new features.
