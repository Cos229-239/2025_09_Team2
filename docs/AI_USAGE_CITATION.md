# AI Usage Citation and Documentation

## Overview
This document provides citation information for AI assistance used in the development of the StudyPals application, in compliance with Full Sail University academic standards. AI was used as a coding assistant tool, not as the primary developer.

## AI Tools Used

### AI Assistant Tool
- **Tool**: GitHub Copilot (Claude-3.5-Sonnet)
- **Provider**: Anthropic (via GitHub)
- **Usage Period**: September 2025
- **Role**: Coding assistant for specific development and debugging assistance tasks
- **Primary Developer**: Yasmani Acosta (Human), Collin Miner (Human), Nolen Millington (Human), Scott Shoemaker (Human), Odette Galvez Sardina (Human)

### AI Integration Features
- **OpenAI GPT Models**: Integrated for flashcard generation and study assistance
- **Google AI (Gemini)**: Alternative AI provider for study content generation
- **Anthropic Claude**: Secondary AI provider option
- **Ollama**: Local AI model support for privacy-focused usage

## Specific AI Contributions

### 1. Code Development Assistance
**AI Role**: Coding assistant and syntax helper
**Human Role**: Architecture design, logic implementation, and project direction
**Scope**: Occasional code suggestions (Albeit very slight) and debugging assistance
**Files Affected**: Various files where specific coding challenges were encountered

**Citation Format**:
```
GitHub Copilot (Claude-3.5-Sonnet). (2025, September). AI coding assistant 
for StudyPals application development. Anthropic via GitHub. 
[Used as supplementary tool for specific coding tasks]
```

### 2. Documentation Support
**AI Role**: Formatting and structure suggestions for documentation
**Human Role**: Content creation, technical specifications, and project documentation
**Scope**: Assistance with markdown formatting and documentation organization
**Files Affected**: README.md, technical documentation files

**Citation Format**:
```
GitHub Copilot (Claude-3.5-Sonnet). (2025, September). Documentation formatting 
assistance for educational technology project. Anthropic via GitHub.
[Limited to formatting and organizational suggestions]
```

## Academic Citation Format

### APA Style (7th Edition)
```
Anthropic. (2025). Claude-3.5-Sonnet via GitHub Copilot [Large language model]. 
https://github.com/features/copilot

Used as: Coding assistant for specific development tasks and documentation 
formatting in StudyPals educational platform development.
```

## Disclosure Statement

### For Academic Submissions
```
This project utilized AI assistance as a supplementary coding tool. GitHub Copilot 
(powered by Claude-3.5-Sonnet from Anthropic) was used occasionally for:

1. Specific coding challenges and syntax assistance
2. Documentation formatting and organization
3. Debugging support for particular issues

The primary development work, including application architecture, design decisions, 
feature implementation, and project management, was completed by the human developer. 
AI served strictly as a coding assistant tool, similar to using an IDE with 
autocomplete features, while all major development decisions and code logic 
remained under human direction and oversight.
```

### For Professional Documentation
```
Development Tools: This application was developed using modern development tools 
including GitHub Copilot as a coding assistant. The AI tool provided occasional 
syntax suggestions and documentation formatting assistance, while all architectural 
decisions, feature design, and implementation logic were completed by the human developer.
```

## Transparency Guidelines

### What to Include
1. **AI tool used** (GitHub Copilot, Claude-3.5-Sonnet)
2. **Role of AI** (coding assistant, not primary developer)
3. **Human responsibility** (architecture, design, logic, testing)
4. **Specific assistance** (syntax help, documentation formatting)
5. **Limited scope** (supplementary tool, not extensive usage)
