## 📋 How It Works

```
User sends message
    ↓
SessionContext.addMessage() stores it
    ↓
User asks: "Remember my favorite color?"
    ↓
_buildAdaptivePrompt() called
    ↓
_buildConversationHistory() - Gets last 20 messages
    ↓
"remember" keyword detected
    ↓
_findRelevantPastMessages() - Semantic search
    ↓
_buildRelevantContext() - Formats relevant messages
    ↓
Prompt includes:
  - CONVERSATION HISTORY (last 20 messages)
  - RELEVANT PAST CONTEXT (semantic matches)
  - CRITICAL MEMORY RETRIEVAL instructions
    ↓
AI reads context and answers: "Your favorite color is blue"
    ↓
AITutorMiddleware validates (✅ Memory: PASSED)
    ↓
Response displayed with status badges
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Before This Enhancement
```
User: "My favorite color is blue"
AI: "Great!"
User: "What's my favorite color?"
AI: "I don't have that information. Can you tell me?"
```
❌ No memory, no context, frustrating UX

### After This Enhancement
```
User: "My favorite color is blue"
AI: "Great! I'll remember that."
User: "What's my favorite color?"
AI: "Your favorite color is blue, as you just mentioned!"
```
✅ Perfect memory recall, ChatGPT-level UX

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test (30 seconds)
1. Open AI Tutor
2. Say: `"My favorite animal is a cat"`
3. Ask: `"What's my favorite animal?"`
4. **Expected**: AI responds `"cat"` with ✅ badge

### Complete Test Suite
See `CONTEXT_AWARENESS_TEST_GUIDE.md` for 5 comprehensive test scenarios
