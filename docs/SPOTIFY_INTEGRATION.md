# StudyPals Spotify Integration - Flutter/Dart Implementation

This document describes the Flutter/Dart implementation of the Spotify integration that replaces the previous JavaScript/HTML implementation.

## Overview

The Spotify integration has been completely converted from JavaScript/HTML to Flutter/Dart, providing a native mobile experience with the same functionality as the original web implementation.

## Architecture

### Files Structure

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ spotify_config.dart          # Configuration and constants
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ spotify_models.dart          # Data models for API responses
â”œâ”€â”€ providers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ spotify_provider.dart        # State management with Provider
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ spotify_integration_screen.dart  # Main UI screen
â””â”€â”€ services/
    â””â”€â”€ spotify_service.dart         # API service layer
```

### Key Components

#### 1. SpotifyConfig (`lib/config/spotify_config.dart`)
- Contains all Spotify API configuration
- OAuth scopes and URLs
- UI theme settings
- Replaces `spotify-config.js`

#### 2. Spotify Models (`lib/models/spotify_models.dart`)
- Type-safe data models for all Spotify API responses
- Includes: SpotifyUser, SpotifyPlaylist, SpotifyTrack, etc.
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Replaces JavaScript objects used in HTML

#### 3. SpotifyService (`lib/services/spotify_service.dart`)
- Handles all Spotify API interactions
- OAuth token management
- HTTP requests to Spotify API
- Local storage for tokens
- Replaces backend functionality from `spotify-server.js`

#### 4. SpotifyProvider (`lib/providers/spotify_provider.dart`)
- State management using Provider pattern
- Coordinates between UI and service layer
- Manages connection states and error handling
- Reactive UI updates

#### 5. SpotifyIntegrationScreen (`lib/screens/spotify_integration_screen.dart`)
- Complete Flutter UI implementation
- Responsive design with Material Design
- Search functionality
- Playlist and track management
- Replaces `spotify-integration.html`

## Features

### âœ… Implemented Features
- **OAuth Authentication**: Complete Spotify OAuth flow
- **User Profile**: Display user information and avatar
- **Playlist Management**: View and select playlists
- **Track Management**: View tracks in playlists
- **Search**: Search for tracks, artists, albums
- **Playlist Creation**: Create new playlists
- **Track Addition**: Add tracks to playlists
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-optimized interface

### ðŸ”„ OAuth Flow
1. User taps "Connect Spotify Account"
2. App launches browser with Spotify OAuth URL
3. User authorizes the app
4. Browser redirects with authorization code
5. App exchanges code for access/refresh tokens
6. Tokens are stored securely using SharedPreferences
7. User can now access Spotify features

### ðŸŽµ Core Functionality
- **Authentication**: Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation
- **API Integration**: Full Spotify Web API integration
- **State Management**: Reactive state with Provider
- **Local Storage**: Secure token storage
- **Network Handling**: Robust HTTP request handling
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic token refresh on expiry

## Dependencies

The following dependencies were added to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  url_launcher: ^6.2.1      # For launching OAuth flow
  cached_network_image: ^3.3.0  # For image caching
  http: ^1.2.0              # For API requests (already present)
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2 # For token storage (already present)
  provider: ^6.0.5          # For state management (already present)
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Spotify App Configuration
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
2. Create a new app or use existing app
3. Set Redirect URI to: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/spotify/callback`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret

### 2. Update Configuration
Edit `lib/config/spotify_config.dart`:
```dart
static const String clientId = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';
static const String clientSecret = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET';
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Navigate to the Spotify Integration screen
2. Tap "Connect Spotify Account"
3. Authorize the app in the browser
4. Return to the app to access Spotify features

### Features Available After Connection
- **View Playlists**: Browse your Spotify playlists
- **View Tracks**: Select a playlist to view its tracks
- **Search Music**: Search for songs, artists, or albums
- **Create Playlists**: Create new playlists
- **Add Tracks**: Add search results to playlists
- **Play Tracks**: Play track previews (when available)

## Security Considerations

- **Client Secret**: Stored securely in the app (not exposed to client)
- **Token Storage**: Tokens stored using SharedPreferences (encrypted on device)
- **HTTPS**: All API requests use HTTPS
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic refresh prevents token exposure
- **OAuth State**: CSRF protection with state parameter

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid tokens
- API rate limiting
- Authentication failures
- User cancellation

## Migration from JavaScript/HTML

### Removed Files
- `package-spotify.json` - Node.js package configuration
- `spotify-config.js` - JavaScript configuration
- `spotify-integration.html` - HTML frontend
- `spotify-server.js` - Node.js backend

### Benefits of Flutter Implementation
- **Native Performance**: Better performance than web implementation
- **Offline Support**: Can cache data and work offline
- **Mobile UX**: Native mobile user experience
- **Type Safety**: Dart's type system prevents runtime errors
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
- **Integration**: Better integration with StudyPals app

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Spotify Web Playback SDK**: Full music playback integration
- **Offline Caching**: Cache playlists and tracks for offline use
- **Social Features**: Share playlists with other StudyPals users
- **Study Playlists**: Create study-focused playlists automatically
- **Background Playback**: Continue music while using other app features
- **Playlist Recommendations**: AI-powered study music recommendations

### Technical Improvements
- **Deep Linking**: Handle OAuth callbacks with deep links
- **Biometric Authentication**: Secure token storage with biometrics
- **Analytics**: Track usage patterns for improvements
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: API documentation and user guides

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. OAuth Redirect Issues
- Ensure redirect URI matches exactly in Spotify app settings
- Check that the app is running on the correct port

#### 2. Token Refresh Failures
- Verify client secret is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure app has proper permissions

#### 3. API Rate Limiting
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Cache responses to reduce API calls
- Monitor API usage in Spotify dashboard

#### 4. UI Issues
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Check Flutter version compatibility
- Verify Material Design theme is properly configured

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify Spotify app configuration
3. Ensure all dependencies are up to date
4. Review the troubleshooting section above
