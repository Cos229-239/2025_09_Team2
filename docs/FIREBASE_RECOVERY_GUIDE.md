## üìã Step-by-Step Recovery Process

### Phase 1: Create New Firebase Project (10 minutes)

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
   - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "Add project" or "Create a project"
   - **Project name**: `StudyPals` (or `StudyPals-Production`)
   - Optionally enable Google Analytics
   - Click "Create project"

3. **Note Your New Project ID**
   - Once created, note the new project ID (it will be different from the old one)
   - You'll see it in the URL and project settings

### Phase 2: Configure Firebase Services (15 minutes)

#### A. Enable Authentication

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Build ‚Üí Authentication**
2. Click "Get started"
3. Enable the following sign-in methods:
   - ‚úÖ Email/Password
   - ‚úÖ Google Sign-In (if needed)
   - ‚úÖ Any other providers you were using

#### B. Enable Firestore Database

1. Go to **Build ‚Üí Firestore Database**
2. Click "Create database"
3. **Select production mode** (we'll deploy our rules)
4. Choose your region (prefer: `us-central1` or closest to your users)
5. Click "Enable"

#### C. Enable Storage

1. Go to **Build ‚Üí Storage**
2. Click "Get started"
3. **Start in production mode** (we'll deploy our rules)
4. Use the same region as Firestore
5. Click "Done"

#### D. Enable Firebase Hosting (if needed)

1. Go to **Build ‚Üí Hosting**
2. Click "Get started"
3. Follow the setup wizard

### Phase 3: Add Your Apps (20 minutes)

#### Android App Setup

1. In Firebase Console, click the Android icon to add an Android app
2. **Android package name**: `com.example.studypals`
3. **App nickname**: StudyPals Android
4. Click "Register app"
5. **Download `google-services.json`**
6. Replace the file at: `android/app/google-services.json`
7. Complete the setup wizard

#### iOS App Setup (if applicable)

1. Click the iOS icon to add an iOS app
2. **iOS bundle ID**: (check your iOS project)
3. **App nickname**: StudyPals iOS
4. Click "Register app"
5. **Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`**
6. Add it to your iOS project
7. Complete the setup wizard

#### Web App Setup (if applicable)

1. Click the Web icon to add a web app
2. **App nickname**: StudyPals Web
3. Register the app
4. Copy the Firebase config object
5. Update your web initialization code

### Phase 4: Deploy Security Rules and Indexes (5 minutes)

After creating the new project, run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd c:\Users\nolen\studypalsv2\StudyPals

# Login to Firebase (if not already)
firebase login

# Select your new project
firebase use --add

# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Firestore indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# Deploy Storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage

# (Optional) Deploy all at once
firebase deploy
```

### Phase 5: Update Local Configuration Files

#### Update `firebase.json` (if needed)

The current `firebase.json` should work, but verify the hosting site name:

```json
{
  "firestore": {
    "rules": "firestore.rules",
    "indexes": "firestore.indexes.json"
  },
  "storage": {
    "rules": "storage.rules"
  },
  "hosting": {
    "site": "studypals",  // Update if needed
    "public": "build/web",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Phase 6: Test the Application (30 minutes)

1. **Build and run the Flutter app**:
   ```powershell
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Test critical features**:
   - ‚úÖ User registration/login
   - ‚úÖ Data persistence (Firestore writes)
   - ‚úÖ File uploads (Storage)
   - ‚úÖ All main app features

3. **Monitor Firebase Console**:
   - Check Firestore for new documents
   - Check Storage for new files
   - Check Authentication for new users

## üîí Security Measures to Prevent Future Incidents

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review Team Access**
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Users and permissions
   - Remove the rogue engineer immediately
   - Review all other team members' access levels

2. **Implement Access Controls**
   - Use **Editor** role only for trusted developers
   - Use **Viewer** role for others who need read access
   - Reserve **Owner** role for only 1-2 trusted people

3. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Require MFA for all team members with Firebase access
   - Go to Google Account settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification

### Long-Term Protections

1. **Separate Production and Development Projects**
   - Create: `StudyPals-Production` (live users)
   - Create: `StudyPals-Development` (testing)
   - Never give developers owner access to production

2. **Set Up Automated Backups**
   
   Create a Cloud Function or scheduled job to export Firestore data:
   ```javascript
   // Example: Daily Firestore backup
   // This requires Blaze plan
   ```

3. **Enable Audit Logging**
   - In Google Cloud Console (not Firebase Console)
   - Go to IAM & Admin ‚Üí Audit Logs
   - Enable audit logs for all Firebase services

4. **Version Control Everything**
   - ‚úÖ Already doing this! Keep it up.
   - Always commit security rules before deploying
   - Use PR reviews for production deployments

5. **Set Up Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Use Firebase Alerts for unusual activity
   - Set up Cloud Monitoring for configuration changes
   - Create Slack/email alerts for critical events

## üìä Data Recovery Options

### If You Have Backups

1. **Check Google Cloud Storage** for any automated exports
2. **Check local databases** - any team members with offline data?
3. **Check staging/development** environments for sample data
4. **Contact Firebase Support** (if on Blaze plan) - they may have point-in-time recovery

### If No Backups Available

Unfortunately, if the project was completely deleted and you have no backups:
- User data is **unrecoverable**
- You'll need to start fresh with new user registrations
- Consider this a hard lesson on the importance of backups

**Recommendation**: 
- Communicate honestly with users about the data loss
- Offer incentives for re-registration
- Implement the backup strategy immediately

## Legal Considerations

Document everything about this incident:
- Screenshots of what's missing
- Timeline of events
- Communication with the rogue engineer
- Financial impact assessment

Consider:
