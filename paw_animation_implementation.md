# Pet Icon Paws Hover-Pinch Animation Implementation

## âœ… Successfully Implemented Paws Animation for Pet Icon

### Animation Details from Lottie File:
- **Duration**: 60 frames at 60fps = 1 second
- **4 Paw Animation**: Each paw animates independently with staggered timing
- **Effect**: Paws move diagonally inward and scale down (pinch effect), then return to normal
- **Staggered Timing**:
  - Paw 1 (Top-left): Frames 2-17-32 (3.3%-28.3%-53.3%)
  - Paw 2 (Top-right): Frames 5-20-35 (8.3%-33.3%-58.3%)
  - Paw 3 (Bottom-left): Frames 7-22-37 (11.7%-36.7%-61.7%)
  - Paw 4 (Bottom-right): Frames 10-25-40 (16.7%-41.7%-66.7%)

### Implementation Features:

1. **Animation Controller**: `_petIconController` with 1-second duration
2. **Custom Painter**: `AnimatedPawsPainter` that renders 4 animated paw prints
3. **Staggered Animation**: Each paw animates at different times creating a wave effect
4. **Position Animation**: Paws move diagonally inward during the pinch effect
5. **Scale Animation**: Paws shrink from 100% to 85% scale during animation
6. **State-Aware**: Only animates when pet tab is selected

### Paw Animation Behavior:

Each paw follows this pattern:
1. **Rest State**: Normal position and size
2. **Move Inward**: Moves 13 units diagonally toward center
3. **Scale Down**: Shrinks to 85% of original size  
4. **Return**: Moves back to original position and size
5. **Timing**: Each paw starts at a different time creating a cascading effect

### Technical Implementation:

```dart
// 4 paws with different base positions and timing
_drawPaw(canvas, paint, scaleX, scaleY, 52.5, 82.5, 0.033, 0.283, 0.533);   // Top-left
_drawPaw(canvas, paint, scaleX, scaleY, 187.5, 82.5, 0.083, 0.333, 0.583);  // Top-right  
_drawPaw(canvas, paint, scaleX, scaleY, 52.5, 172.5, 0.117, 0.367, 0.617);  // Bottom-left
_drawPaw(canvas, paint, scaleX, scaleY, 187.5, 172.5, 0.167, 0.417, 0.667); // Bottom-right

// Position animation (diagonal movement)
double offsetX = (baseX < 120) ? 13 * pawProgress : -13 * pawProgress;
double offsetY = (baseY < 120) ? 13 * pawProgress : -13 * pawProgress;

// Scale animation (shrink effect)
double scale = 1.0 - (0.15 * pawProgress); // 1.0 to 0.85
```

### Usage:
1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Tap the Pet tab in the bottom navigation
3. Watch the 4 paw prints perform the staggered hover-pinch animation
4. Switch to other tabs to see the animation stop

### Visual Effect:
The animation creates a delightful "paws walking inward" effect where each paw print appears to step closer to the center in sequence, then all return to their original positions. This gives the impression of a playful pet interaction that perfectly complements the StudyPals theme.

The paw animation is now active and will trigger whenever the Pet tab is selected!
